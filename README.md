# A Simple Little Game in JavaScript

While wandering about a field filled with deadly holes (as you do) a gust of wind blew your hat (looks like a ^) off. You must get it back!

Navigate a possibly-unwinnable maze using simple commands and take back what's yours!* 

coded and tested using a Node.js repl. Mostly notable for its novelty and fairly clean game logic.

Run this in your terminal and have fun!
